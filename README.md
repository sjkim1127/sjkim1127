### Software Engineer | Security & AI

I am a developer focused on **Automated Security Analysis** and **Agentic AI Workflows**.
My primary interest lies in building scalable systems that bridge the gap between static/dynamic analysis tools and Large Language Models (LLMs).

I enjoy architecting hybrid systems that orchestrate complex security tools like Frida, Radare2, and GDB to automate manual analysis tasks.
