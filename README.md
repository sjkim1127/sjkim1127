### Software Architect | Security & AI Toolsmith

> **"I don't just write code; I craft tools that empower people."**

I define myself as an **Architect**. My focus is not on the act of coding itself, but on creating meaningful **tools** that users can rely on.

I am **agnostic to technology stacks**. I believe that the right language builds the right tool—whether it's Rust for performance or Python for flexibility. I build what I envision, actively leveraging **AI** to transcend the limits of traditional engineering.

### 🛠️ Philosophy & Architecture

- **Toolsmith Mindset**: I build solutions that bridge the gap between complex low-level systems and human usability.
- **Polyglot Engineering**: Unbound by specific frameworks. I use the best tool for the job to build scalable, high-performance systems.
- **AI-Native Development**: I treat AI not just as a feature, but as a core partner in my development workflow to accelerate innovation.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

### ⚛️ [Fission](https://github.com/sjkim1127/Fission)
**The Unified Workbench for Hybrid Analysis**
A next-generation hybrid dynamic analysis platform that unifies the best features of **x64dbg**, **Frida**, **Radare2**, and **Ghidra** into a single Rust-powered binary. It serves as the central command center for both static and dynamic engineering tasks.

### 👻 [Reversecore_MCP](https://github.com/sjkim1127/Reversecore_MCP)
**The Intelligence Layer for Binary Analysis**
An AI-driven static analysis toolset that leverages the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to enhance binary understanding and automate threat detection. It acts as the "Brain," handling logic, pattern matching, and AI reasoning.

### 🦾 [Nexuscore_MCP](https://github.com/sjkim1127/Nexuscore_MCP)
**The Kinetic Engine for Dynamic Instrumentation**
An AI-powered MCP server specialized for dynamic malware analysis. It orchestrates **Frida** instrumentation, session-based debugging, and 46+ security tools to perform real-time memory manipulation and behavioral analysis.
